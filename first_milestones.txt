So, it appears that I've been given the task of making sure that everybody can access the GitHub account and knows how to use it, as well as setting milestones.

GitHub Account(Case Sensitive): redTeamIsTheRadTeam
Password: (please see the wiki, first milestones)

This login information is current as of 3/10.

A week ago I pushed a readme and a changelog. The readme can wait until the end.

I'm assuming that everybody can use GitHub in some capacity as far as pushing commits.

If you don't know how to use GitHub, send me your OS information (my contact info is in a separate wiki page. Blackboard Mail also works for me) so it can be determined which is the best method for you to use. Personally, I use a GUI client for Windows primarily. Whenever I'm running Debian, I'll push from the terminal.

In any event, if you do know how to use GitHub, update the changelog (I'm going to do an update after writing this), just to see who can.

At the class meeting today, everybody recieved tasks. Upon a successful test, you should probably push your code to the repository. The first milestone should be every class capable of running at least by itself within a test method or driver class. If you were not in class today (3/10), I think there were still some unassigned tasks.

There is also a team Gmail account, set up by Josh (who likewise provided the GitHub account):

Gmail Account:   (please see the wiki, first milestones)
Password:   (please see the wiki, first milestones)

There is a draft in the drafts folder than can be updated with notes or other communication.
